  "topic": "Mongolian Barbeque and its Influence on American Cuisine",
  "summary": "Mongolian barbeque, despite its name, is not actually Mongolian in origin. It was developed in Taiwan in the 1950s by a waishengren and is more similar to teppanyaki than traditional barbecue. However, it has become popular in American Chinese cuisine, with chains allowing customers to customize their own stir-fry dishes on a circular grill. The simplicity and bold flavors of Mongolian beef in particular have contributed to its widespread popularity on American menus. While not historically accurate, the techniques of high-heat rapid stir-frying have become an integral part of American Chinese cuisine.",
